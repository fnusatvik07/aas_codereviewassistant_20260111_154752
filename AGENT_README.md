## API Endpoints

- **GET** `/` - Service information
- **POST** `/query` - Send queries to the agent (non-streaming)
- **POST** `/stream` - Send queries with real-time streaming
- **GET** `/health` - Health check
- **GET** `/info` - Agent information

## Example Usage

### Python
```python
import requests

# Send a query to the agent
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/query",
    json={"prompt": "Your question here", "max_turns": 5}
)

result = response.json()
print(result["response"])
```

### cURL
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/query" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"prompt": "Hello, what can you do?", "max_turns": 3}'
```

### Streaming Example
```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/stream",
    json={"prompt": "Tell me about AI", "max_turns": 5},
    stream=True,
    headers={'Accept': 'text/event-stream'}
)

for line in response.iter_lines(decode_unicode=True):
    if line.startswith('data: '):
        event_data = json.loads(line[6:])
        print(f"Event: {event_data['type']} - {event_data['data']}")
```

## Deployment Options
